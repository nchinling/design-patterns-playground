# Design Pattern playground
A repository for me to tinker with design pattern concepts

## 1. interfacePattern
Implementation of interface for game characters based on character class. Different characters override the methods implemented in the game moves interface. 

## 2. Builder Pattern
Prevents instantiation of classes with unused parameters and reduces the need for creation of unnecessary subclasses.
